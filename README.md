# MapEditor

This project is a simple paint application, which allows the user to run through a grid (resizable as per the user's wish) and paint the desired squares.
The program was created with Java 19 and uses a SimpleGFX lib (https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics).

The application allows the user to:
- Choose the size of the grid (in the main class),
- Run through the grid using a cursor (use the Up, Down, Right, Left arrows),
- Paint the square in which the cursor is currently on (press Space in your Keyboard),
- Clean the entire grid and go to the initial clean grid (press C),
- You can save your current drawing (press S),
- Reload your last drawing, if any (by pressing L).
